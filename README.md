# M012-Group6 Instructions for Code:

The P1_Code file contains both, the encode and decode programs within it. 

How the encode works:
  Have the file labelled as "textToEncode.txt" open and "encodedText.txt" open.
  Take the complete text and paste it into that file.
  Then, run the code, and it should encode it on to the file labelled as "encodedText.txt".
  
How the decode works:
  Have the files before and the file labelled "textToDecode.txt" and "decodedText.txt" open.
  Take the encoded text from the "encodedText.txt" file and remove the number of bits and the ".", leaving just the binary part of '0's and '1's.
  Paste that into the "textToDecode.txt" file and run the code.
  It should write the deocded text into the "decodedText.txt" file.
